# POC Java 25 — Generated classes

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (POC) project demonstrating the most relevant new features introduced in Java 25. The code samples are structured to provide hands-on examples that developers can build upon when exploring the latest language, runtime, and API enhancements.

## Features Covered

- Structured Concurrency (Preview) — Simplified management of concurrent tasks with automatic cancellation and error propagation.

- Scoped Values (Final) — Safer alternative to ThreadLocal for passing immutable context values across threads.

- Flexible Constructor Bodies (Final) — Logic and validation allowed before calling super(...) in constructors.

- Primitive Types in Patterns (Preview) — Use primitive types directly in pattern matching with switch and instanceof.

- Vector API (Incubator) — SIMD/vector operations for high-performance numerical processing.

- PEM Encodings for Cryptographic Objects (Preview) — Encode/decode cryptographic material into PEM format.

- Compact Source Files & Instance Main Methods (Final) — Create small utility programs with reduced boilerplate.

- JFR Profiling Improvements — Hooks for leveraging Java Flight Recorder to measure execution time and performance.
